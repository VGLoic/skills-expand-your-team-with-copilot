        **For Copilot coding agent:** Technical details for implementing design changes.
        
        **Current Styling Architecture:**
        - Main CSS file: `src/static/styles.css`
        - HTML structure: `src/static/index.html`
        - CSS uses CSS custom properties (variables) for colors
        - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
        - Current color scheme defined in CSS variables
        
        **Design System:**
        - Layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox
        - Modal dialogs for registration and login
        - Activity cards in responsive grid layout
        - Filter sidebar with collapsible sections
      value: |
        **Implementation Areas:**
        - [ ] CSS updates in `src/static/styles.css`
        - [ ] HTML structure changes in `src/static/index.html`
        - [ ] Asset additions (logos, images) if needed
        - [ ] CSS custom property updates for color scheme
        - [ ] Responsive design testing
        
        **CSS Architecture Notes:**
        - Update CSS custom properties (`:root` variables) for color changes
        - Maintain existing responsive breakpoints
        - Preserve accessibility (contrast ratios, focus states)
        - Test all interactive states (hover, active, focus)
        - Ensure mobile compatibility
        
        **Design Implementation Steps:**
        1. Update color variables in CSS
        2. Modify header and navigation styling
        3. Update button and interactive element styles
        4. Adjust activity card appearance
        5. Test responsive design on mobile
        6. Verify accessibility standards
        
        **Testing Requirements:**
        - [ ] Design works on desktop and mobile
        - [ ] All interactive elements are properly styled
        - [ ] Color contrast meets accessibility standards
        - [ ] Layout remains functional with new design
        - [ ] Print styles work if needed
        - [ ] Design loads quickly and efficiently
