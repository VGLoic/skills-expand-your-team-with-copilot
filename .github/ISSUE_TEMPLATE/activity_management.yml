        - `start_time`, `end_time`: Schedule

        - `participants`: Array of enrolled student emails
        
        **Key Files:**
        - Database operations: `src/backend/database.py`
        - Activity API: `src/backend/routers/activities.py`
        - Frontend display: `src/static/app.js`
